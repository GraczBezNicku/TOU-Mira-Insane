When contributing to TOU: Mira, we implore you to make your PRs into the dev branch rather than the main branch.
Doing so will be FAR easier for everyone involved, as it means that updates are merged together properly

We will generally take some time to accept or deny Role/Modifier PRs, but that's just because we want to avoid throwing too much content at once while working away at much more needed bugfixes.
Another thing; don't try to port Sidemen-only roles into here, that's very silly to do.
